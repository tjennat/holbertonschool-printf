## Description of the project

In this project, we should create a function like printf who allow to print a string of caracters. 

## What is the function printf ?
 
This function take in first argument a string and others arguments of data type if necessary. This string is composed of caracters between a double quote "". And among this caracters who can have a or many format specification starts a percent sign and ends with a letter. Here in our function, we will use the format **%c**, **%s**, **%%**, **%d** and **%i**.

Each format have a different meaning : :arrow_heading_down: 
* %c : to print a single caracter
* %s : to print a string of caracters
* %% : just to print a percent
* %d : to print a decimal number
* %i : to print an integer in base 10

## Prerequisites

*  

## Compilation

* Our code will be compiled this way:
```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```
## Requirements

* Allowed editors : vi, vim, emacs -> we use vi here
* To have the Betty style
* A README.md (logic I'm writing in it :hand:)
